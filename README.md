# Learn Similarity API - Project Setup Documentation

## Initial Setup

1. Navigate to the desired project directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/project/directory
   ```

2. Create a new Next.js app using the following command:
   ```
   npx create-next-app@latest learn-similarity-api
   ```

3. During the setup, you were prompted with several options. You chose the default options for most of these. Typically, these options include:
   - Would you like to use TypeScript? (Likely Yes)
   - Would you like to use ESLint? (Likely Yes)

4. After the project was created, navigate into the project directory:
   ```
   cd learn-similarity-api
   ```

## Installing Dependencies

After creating the Next.js app, you installed a comprehensive set of dependencies to enhance your project's capabilities. You used the following command to install these dependencies:

```
npm install @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/material @mui/system @mui/x-data-grid @next-auth/prisma-adapter @prisma/client @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu @radix-ui/react-scroll-area @radix-ui/react-tabs @total-typescript/ts-reset @upstash/ratelimit @upstash/redis class-variance-authority clsx date-fns framer-motion lodash lucide-react nanoid next-auth next-themes openai prism-react-renderer prisma react-hot-toast sharp simplebar-react tailwind-merge zod

## Project Structure

The basic structure of a Next.js project typically looks like this:

```
learn-similarity-api/
├── pages/
├── public/
├── styles/
├── .gitignore
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── tsconfig.json (if using TypeScript)
```

Note: If you chose to use the `src/` directory, your `pages/` and `styles/` directories would be inside `src/`.

## Next Steps

After setting up your project and installing dependencies, you might want to:

1. Set up your database with Prisma
2. Configure NextAuth.js for authentication
3. Create your first API routes
4. Set up your Material-UI theme
5. Start building your React components

Remember to commit your changes to version control regularly as you develop your project.
